# woodknotlabeller

This web site provides the active learning experience by labelling the wood knot images. It's divided into four wizards: About; Learn to label - get instructions; Learn to label - practice labeling; Ready to Label.

Each participant's experience is marked with a unique session ID, which is generated at Wizard One and destroyed at Wizard Four when the Finish button is clicked. Users will be rendered with different orders of a paginated image data set, to guarantee the maximum coverage of practice and labelling.

The practice set is attached with correct labels in advance. During practice, upon finishing one page of labelling, the participant is presented with a summary table of how he/she has done for that page. Only after one can label the images correctly with one attempt, will the next page follow along to display. This blocking mechanism is set to ensure the participant gets the most learning out of practice.

All the practice labels and real labels are captured in a database for future analysis.
